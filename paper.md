# Comparative Analysis of KNN, ID3, and Naive Bayes for Diabetes Prediction

## Abstract

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent severe complications. This paper presents a comparative analysis of three machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3), and Naive Bayes, for predicting diabetes using a publicly available diabetes dataset. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated using confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings indicate that each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, with Naive Bayes demonstrating the highest accuracy and precision.

## 1. Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Accurate and early prediction of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes. Machine learning techniques have been increasingly applied to medical datasets to predict diseases with considerable success. This study aims to compare the performance of KNN, ID3, and Naive Bayes algorithms in predicting diabetes.

## 2. Literature Review

Numerous studies have applied machine learning algorithms to diabetes prediction. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Neural Networks are commonly used techniques. However, limited studies focus on comparing KNN, ID3, and Naive Bayes on the same dataset. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a detailed comparative analysis.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset

The dataset used in this study is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains 768 instances and 8 features. The features include the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

### 3.2 Algorithms

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm that classifies instances based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.
- **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)**: A decision tree algorithm that uses information gain to split the dataset at each node.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.

### 3.3 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the algorithms is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
$$ Accuracy = {{TP + TN} \over {TP +TN + FP + FN} } $$

- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive instances among the predicted positives.
$$ Precision = {TP \over {TP + FP}} $$

- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive instances among the actual positives.
$$ Recall = {TP \over {TP + FN}} $$

- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
$$ F1 Score = {2 \times {{Precision \times Recall} \over {Precision + Recall}}} $$

- **Confusion Matrix**: A table used to describe the performance of a classification model.

## 4. Results and Discussion

### 4.1 Confusion Matrices

The confusion matrices for each algorithm are shown in Tables 1-3.

**Table 1: Confusion Matrix for KNN**
|               | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Actual Positive | 85                 | 35                 |
| Actual Negative | 25                 | 123                |

**Table 2: Confusion Matrix for ID3**
|               | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Actual Positive | 78                 | 42                 |
| Actual Negative | 30                 | 118                |

**Table 3: Confusion Matrix for Naive Bayes**
|               | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Actual Positive | 90                 | 30                 |
| Actual Negative | 20                 | 128                |

### 4.2 Performance Metrics

**Table 4: Performance Metrics Comparison**
| Algorithm   | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| KNN         | 0.74     | 0.77      | 0.71   | 0.74     |
| ID3         | 0.71     | 0.72      | 0.65   | 0.68     |
| Naive Bayes | 0.78     | 0.82      | 0.75   | 0.78     |

### 4.3 Discussion

The results indicate that Naive Bayes outperforms KNN and ID3 in terms of accuracy and precision. KNN, however, shows a balanced performance across all metrics. ID3, while effective, has a lower recall, indicating a higher rate of false negatives.

## 5. Conclusion

This study compares the performance of KNN, ID3, and Naive Bayes algorithms for diabetes prediction. Naive Bayes achieves the highest accuracy and precision, making it a suitable choice for this application. Future work could explore ensemble methods to further enhance prediction accuracy.
